Pac-man coding practice using Javascript and HTML

## Overview
This is the Pac-man excercise from Module 7. Two buttons are displayed on page load: Add PacMan and Start Game. You can add as many Pacmen. Once Start Game is clicked, Pacman will begin chomping and moving in all directions within the bounds of the window. Once it collides with an edge, Pacman will turn around and continue chomping in the opposite direction.

## How to Run 
[Click here](https://zikman23.github.io/pacman/) to run the program, or clone the repo/download the files and run it locally in your browser.

## Roadmap of future improvements 
In keeping with the theme, I would like to add a ghost character to the game. If Pacman collides with the ghost, it would be 'game over'. It will be good practice to learn how to code object collisions, in addition to the DOM/browser window collisions that are already displayed.
